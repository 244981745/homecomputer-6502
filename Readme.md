HomeComputer 6502
=================

This is a project that I've often started, but haven't completed until now because i knew that it would take quite a long
time: building my own 8-bit home computer from scratch. The idea was to design a computer like the C64, almost only using
parts that were available when this computer was manufactured.

Documentation of this project can be found on my website: http://www.grappendorf.net/projects/6502-homecomputer

This repositiory contains the following files:

* eagle - Eagle schematic and board files
* schematics - PDF schematics
* case - 123D/STL design files for the case
* firmware - Minimal BASIC interpreter written with CC65,  different versions of the firmware during the development process
* terminal -  Small ruby script for loading/saving of BASIC programs
